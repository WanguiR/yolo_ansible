# E-commerce Application Deployment with Ansible

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the containerized E-commerce application on your computer using Ansible.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

  
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
   cd YourRepository

2. **Create an Ansible Playbook**

Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., deploy.yml) in the project directory and define the tasks for setting up the application. 

3. **Define Your Ansible Roles**

Organize your Ansible roles for the frontend and backend components. Ensure that each role has a structured directory with a tasks/main.yml file.

4. **Update Variables and Paths**

Review the playbook and roles to ensure that variables and paths match your specific project requirements. Customize the variables to suit your needs.

5. **Deploy the Application**
Run the Ansible Playbook

Execute the Ansible playbook to set up and deploy the application. Replace deploy.yml with the actual name of your playbook.

 ansible-playbook deploy.yml

This command will configure the server, clone the application code, set up the frontend and backend components, and deploy the application.

6. **Access Your Application**

Once the playbook execution is complete, you can access your E-commerce application through a web browser. Simply open a browser and navigate to the server's IP address or domain name.

Server IP: http://YourServerIP
Server Domain: http://YourServerDomain
Congratulations! Your E-commerce application is now up and running.

Notes
Make sure your server's network settings allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the Ansible playbook and make system changes.
Customize the project structure and roles to match your application's components and requirements.
Enjoy using your fully deployed E-commerce application!

For more information and troubleshooting, refer to the project's documentation.

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `YourUsername`, `YourRepository`, `YourServerIP`, `YourServerDomain`, etc.) with your actual project details. This README provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and deploying your E-commerce application using Ansible.
